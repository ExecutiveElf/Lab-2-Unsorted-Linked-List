 Lab 2 Unsorted Linked List
 A data structure of objects arranged in a linear order.
  The order is determined by a pointer in each object.
  See definition on pg. 134 and implementation on pg.
  167 of the 6th edition of C++ Plus Data Structures.
  Your welcome to learn from the books implementation,
  however, make sure to write your own code. This unsorted
  list must be implemented with pointers. You will then
  write a client code that will have a function that will
  take two unsorted lists and perform the union set
  operation. The resulting new unsorted list will
  consist of all the unique items from the original
  two lists with no duplicates.

int main() /*I'm going to be completely honest, I have know idea what the stuff in the other files
		   does. It's all out of the book at it was all looking fine for like 3 hours of typing it in
		   then all turned red at once and I honestly don't know why. I don't know how to fix it, much
		   less make a client file for it. All I can do is ask for your pity here as I turn this in
		   at 9 PM after working on this for the past 5 hours after needing to completly start
		   over so that I can hopefully salvage the points from the write up for the semester project.
		   I tried, I really did. But I just don't understand this in the slightest.*/
